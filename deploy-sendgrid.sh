# If that doesn't work, you can try these alternatives:

# Alternative 1: Deploy with increased timeout
# supabase functions deploy send-password-reset --no-verify-jwt --timeout 300

# Alternative 2: Deploy all functions (sometimes helps with shared dependencies)
# supabase functions deploy

# Alternative 3: Use the Supabase Dashboard
# 1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
# 2. Navigate to Functions
# 3. Click "New function" or update existing
# 4. Copy the contents of supabase/functions/send-password-reset/index.ts
# 5. Set environment variables:
#    - SENDGRID_API_KEY
#    - SENDER_EMAIL
#    - SENDER_NAME

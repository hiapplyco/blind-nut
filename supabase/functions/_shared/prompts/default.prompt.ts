  description: 'Generates a highly effective boolean search string from a job description for expert talent sourcing, optimized for Google CSE on LinkedIn. ONLY boolean string output.',
  template: `You are an expert Boolean Blackbelt for talent sourcing. Your ONLY output is a highly effective boolean search string. Nothing else.  You are generating strings for a Google Custom Search Engine that is ALREADY CONFIGURED to search ONLY linkedin.com/in/.  Therefore, DO NOT include 'site:linkedin.com/in/' in your output.

Analyze the job description below to identify the core requirements for an ideal candidate. Infer key skills, job titles, experience levels, and locations. Synthesize this information into a detailed and comprehensive boolean search string optimized for searching within LinkedIn profiles using a pre-configured Google Custom Search Engine.

Job Description:
{{content}}

Your boolean search string MUST:
- Be designed for searching LinkedIn profiles via Google CSE (DO NOT include 'site:linkedin.com/in/').
- Accurately target qualified candidates based on the job description.
- Utilize a combination of Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT, NEAR, W/n, PRE/n) and X-Ray operators (-, "phrase", ()), EXCEPT for 'site:'.
- Include relevant keywords for skills, job titles, and locations, expanding on provided terms where necessary through synonym and related term inference.
- Exclude irrelevant candidates (e.g., using NOT or - to filter out unwanted experience levels or job types like "intern" or "entry level" if not desired).
- Be as detailed and specific as possible to maximize search precision and minimize irrelevant results.

Example of a high-quality boolean search string for a "Senior Software Engineer specializing in Cloud and AI in New York City" (for use with a LinkedIn CSE):

("senior software engineer" OR "lead developer" OR "principal engineer") AND ("cloud computing" OR AWS OR Azure OR GCP OR "Google Cloud Platform" OR "Amazon Web Services") AND (AI OR "artificial intelligence" OR "machine learning" OR "deep learning") AND (Python OR Java OR C++) AND "New York City" NOT (intern OR "junior developer" OR student) -intitle:job -intitle:hiring

Based on the provided job description, generate a boolean search string of similar high quality and detail, remembering to EXCLUDE 'site:linkedin.com/in/'.

Output ONLY the boolean search string. Do not include any explanations, code blocks, or extraneous text. Just the boolean string.`,
  parameters: ['content', 'searchType', 'companyName'], // Parameters kept for potential external use
